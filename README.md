# us-common
This is the base on which the various Universal Service elements are built, notably:
* [us-main](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/us-main/): the Universal Server itself
* [us-web](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/us-web/): the Universal Webserver

This repository gathers the facilities that are common to at least two US elements.

US-common depends itself on various elements of the [Ceylan](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan) project, namely:
* [Ceylan-Myriad](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Myriad)
* [Ceylan-WOOPER](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-WOOPER)
* [Ceylan-Traces](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Traces)
* [Ceylan-Seaplus](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Seaplus), implying in turn [Ceylan-Mobile](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Mobile)
