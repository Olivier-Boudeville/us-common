This repository corresponds to the **base elements on which the various Universal Services** are built, notably:
* the Universal Server itself: see [us-main](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/us-main/)
* the Universal Webserver: see [us-web](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/us-web/)

This repository gathers indeed the base facilities for the US infrastructure; as such it is a part of the [Universal Server](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Universal-Server) project.

Please refer to the [US-Common official documentation](http://us-common.esperide.org) for further information, otherwise to its [mirror](http://olivier-boudeville.github.io/us-common/).

As for US-common, it depends itself on various elements of the [Ceylan](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan) project, namely:
* [Ceylan-Myriad](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Myriad)
* [Ceylan-WOOPER](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-WOOPER)
* [Ceylan-Traces](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Traces)
* [Ceylan-Seaplus](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Seaplus), implying in turn [Ceylan-Mobile](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Mobile)

The 'master' branch is aimed to be the current stable version of this layer.
